*ChatAcadien is an LLM-based conversational agent designed to provide interactive access to Acadian genealogical records dating from 1700-1900. The application is accessible at [https://chatacadien.ca/](https://chatacadien.ca/).*

## Overview

ChatAcadien serves as a specialized knowledge base assistant for researchers and individuals interested in Acadian genealogy and history. The system provides access to genealogical records, historical information, and institutional documentation from the Centre d'Ã©tudes acadiennes Anselme-Chiasson (CEAAC) at the University of Moncton.

## Funding & Acknowledgments
